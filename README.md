## Scripts

- **start:** Builds and starts the application.
- **dev:** Runs the application in dev mode. Automatically restarts on changes in the *src* directory.
- **devb:** Same as dev, but does not transpile client side code. Only used for back-end side development.
- **build:** Transpile typescript files and copy results to dist directory.
- **types:** Adds the missing type definitions as dependencies.
